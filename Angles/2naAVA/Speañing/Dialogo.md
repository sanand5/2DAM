**Phone Call between Andrew Sanz Sanz and Director Rachel**

**Rachel:** Hello, this is Rachel speaking. How may I help you?

**Andrew:** Hi, Rachel. This is Andrew Sanz Sanz. I'm calling because I have a serious complaint about Professor Charly.

**Rachel:** Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Andrew. What seems to be the issue?

**Andrew:** Well, it's about the assignments he's been giving us in the Access to Data course. They are incredibly demanding and, frankly, quite unreasonable. We've been working on implementing FTP servers and managing ExistDB databases, and it's becoming overwhelming.

**Rachel:** I see. Can you please provide more details on why you find these assignments unreasonable?

**Andrew:** Of course. Firstly, the workload is excessive. It feels like he doesn't consider that we have other classes and responsibilities. Moreover, his explanations are minimal, making it very difficult for us to understand the material. And worst of all, the grading process takes forever. It's affecting our learning experience.

**Rachel:** I'm sorry to hear that, Andrew. I'll take a look into this matter as soon as possible. We value the feedback from our students.

**Andrew:** Thank you, Rachel. It's just that it's been a source of great stress, and I believe we deserve a more professional and considerate approach to our learning.

**Rachel:** I completely understand. We want to provide a positive learning environment for our students. I'll address this issue with Professor Charly and make sure it won't happen again.

**Andrew:** I appreciate that, Rachel. It's not just me; many of my classmates feel the same way. It's affecting the entire class's attitude towards the subject.

**Rachel:** I apologize for the inconvenience, Andrew. I'll make it a priority to solve this problem. In the meantime, is there anything specific you would suggest to improve the situation?

**Andrew:** Well, perhaps Professor Charly could be more patient and polite in his explanations. A bit more guidance and understanding would go a long way. Also, a timely response to our queries would be helpful.

**Rachel:** I'll certainly address these concerns with him. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and I'll ensure that the necessary changes are made. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Andrew.

**Andrew:** Thank you, Rachel. I hope this can be resolved soon. It's affecting not just my grades but also the overall learning experience for all of us.

**Rachel:** I'll do my best to resolve it promptly. If you have any further concerns, feel free to reach out. We're here to support you.
